Welcome to Google C++ Mocking Framework!

Inspired by [http://www.jmock.org/ jMock], [http://www.easymock.org/ EasyMock], and [http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/ Hamcrest], *Google C++ Mocking
Framework* (or *Google Mock* for short) is a library for writing and
using C++ mock classes.  We have enjoyed it in many projects at
Google, and hope you find it useful too.

If you are new to the project, we suggest to read the user
documentation in the following order:

  * Learn the [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/GoogleTestPrimer basics] of [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/ Google C++ Testing Framework], which is currently required by Google Mock.  (Eventually we plan to support using Google Mock with other C++ testing frameworks.)
  * Read [ForDummies Google Mock for Dummies].
  * Read the instructions on how to [http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/source/browse/#svn/trunk/README build Google Mock].

Once you understand the basics, check out the rest of the docs:

  * CheatSheet - all the commonly used stuff at a glance.
  * CookBook - recipes for getting things done, including advanced techniques.

If you have problems, please check the FrequentlyAskedQuestions before posting a question on the [http://groups.google.com/group/googlemock googlemock] discussion group.

If you want to contribute to the development of Google Mock, please
read the DevGuide.

Happy mocking!

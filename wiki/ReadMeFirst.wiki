Welcome to Google C++ Mocking Framework!

*Google C++ Mocking Framework* (or *Google Mock* for short) is a library
for writing and using C++ mock classes.  We have enjoyed it in many
projects at Google, and hope you find it useful too.

If you are new to the project, we suggest to read the user
documentation in the following order:

  # [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/GoogleTestPrimer GoogleTestPrimer] - teaches the basics of [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/ Google C++ Testing Framework], which is currently required by Google Mock.  (Eventually we plan to support using Google Mock with other C++ testing frameworks.)
  # ForDummies - gets you started with Google Mock.
  # CheatSheet - all the commonly used stuff at a glance.
  # CookBook - recipes for getting things done, including advanced techniques.
  # FrequentlyAskedQuestions - please check here first before posting a question on the [http://groups.google.com/group/googlemock googlemock] discussion group.

If you want to contribute to the development of Google Mock, please read the DevGuide.

Happy mocking!
